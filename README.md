# Optical Character Recognition (OCR) with MATLAB

## Usage

Change directory in MATLAB to the one containing `main.m`

Modify `numTest` in `main.m` line 11 to change the number of data points to your desired value.

Execute `main.m` in MATLAB, with `OCR.m` and the `MNIST` folder in the same directory

## Acknowledgements

OCR was performed using Principle Component Analysis (PCA) based on the algorithm from [algosome.com](https://www.algosome.com/articles/optical-character-recognition-java.html)

Credits to [the MNIST database](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) for the processed data. Files can also be found in `MNIST/`
